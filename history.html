          <h2>The Legendary Gooty Fort</h2>
          <p>Perched atop a conical hill at an elevation of about 300 meters, the Gooty Fort is one of the most remarkable hill forts in India. The fort, also known as "Gutti Kota," has a rich history dating back several centuries.</p>
          <p>The fort was built during the Chalukya period and later came under the control of various dynasties including the Vijayanagara Empire, the Qutb Shahis, and the Mughals. In the 18th century, it was controlled by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan before coming under British rule.</p>
          <p>The fort is known for its impressive architecture, with multiple levels of fortifications, gates, and structures built on the steep hillside. It offers panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and remains a symbol of the region's historical significance.</p>
